We offer two kinds of plain language training:

## Introductory classes

We provide a free half-day introduction to plain language to federal agencies. You must have at least 15—20 participants. Ask if one of our experienced trainers is available for your agency.

## Train-the-trainer bootcamp

We need trainers to help us provide plain language training to government agencies. Our trainers are federal employees from across the government who volunteer 1–2 classes a year (besides their own agencies)

If you are interested in becoming a trainer and have received permission from your supervisor to teach at least 1 or 2 classes a year, attend a Train-the-trainer Bootcamp. We offer these quarterly.
