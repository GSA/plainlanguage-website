We offer two kinds of plain language training:

## Introductory classes

We provide a free half-day introduction to plain language to federal agencies. You must have at least 20 participants. Ask if one of our experienced trainers is available for your agency.

## Train-the-trainer bootcamp

We need trainers to help us provide plain language training to government agencies. Our trainers are federal employees from across the government who volunteer 1â€“2 classes a year (outside of their own agencies). We offer these quarterly.
