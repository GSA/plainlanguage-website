If you want to develop your own plain-language training, we can help you work with one of our trained instructors to set up a course. As a first step, you'll want to look at our training materials to get an idea of what you should cover. If you need more help, [contact us](../../site/contactus.cfm?subject=training). We've included other resources that can help you present training in plain language. We also periodically offer a [Train-the-Trainer bootcamp](../../resources/take_training/bootcamp.cfm).

_[Federal Plain Language Guidelines](../../howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/index.cfm)_ is our basic handbook for plain-language writers. You can use it to structure a training course. It makes a good text or reference for your students.

You can also take our [class materials](PLAIN.cfm) and use or modify them to create your own class.

_[Writing Effective Letters](../../howto/guidelines/letters.cfm)_ is a supplement to _Federal Plain Language Guidelines_.

Here are our [Tips for Starting a plain-language program](../../howto/tipsforstarting/index.cfm)

The FAA has made its [Plain Language Toolkit](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/plain_language/media/toolkit.pdf) available.

Here are some [additional resources](details.cfm) about organizing documents, using the active voice, and using lists and tables. Use them to flesh out your training materials.
