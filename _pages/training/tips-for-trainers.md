Starting a plain language program can be challenging. But like most challenges, the reward will far outweigh the effort. The reward in this case is clear communication—an asset for any organization.

## Getting started

As a first step, you'll want to look at our training materials to get an idea of what you should cover:

- The [Federal Plain Language Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/) is our handbook for writers. You can use it to structure a training course. It makes a good text or reference for your students.

- You can also use our training materials to [create your own class]({{ site.baseurl }}/training/create-your-own-class/).

## Set SMART goals

SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and have a timeframe.

- Start with a clearly defined goal, and communicate your expectations to everyone involved in the effort.
- Implement a training program so that the entire organization is on the same page.
- Look for small successes and aim for continuous improvement—not rapid change.
- Revise first those documents that have the biggest circulation and are the hardest to understand.
- Post examples of clearly written documents on a website or home directory as a reference tool.
- Evaluate your progress frequently and seek feedback. Adjust your course if necessary.
- Designate "go to" people on your staff who are accessible and knowledgeable.
- Make sure your top managers are plain language practitioners.
- Encourage these managers to champion the process.

## Follow plain language guidelines

There are some best practices to follow when writing with plain language. Below are a few to help you get started, and more can be found on [Federal plain language guidelines]({{ site.basurl }}/guidelines/).

- [Have a topic sentence]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/organize/have-a-topic-sentence/). Good opening sentences help organize the structure of writing. 

- [Use the active voice]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/conversational/use-active-voice/). Active voice helps the message stay clear and easy-to-read.

- [Organize the information]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/organize/). Prepare readers for what to expect by summarizing lengthy documents up-front and being precise on the subject lines of letters and email messages.
  
- [Use tables]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/design/use-tables-to-make-complex-material-easier-to-understand/). You can use tables effectively for much more than just showing numerical data.

- [Use lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/organize/use-lists/). Using lists instead of traditional paragraphs can help you convey detailed information quickly without overloading your readers.
