PLAIN is dedicated to helping federal agencies train their staff to communicate clearly and develop their own plain language programs.

We offer free, half day plain language and writing for the web training classes for all federal agencies. All of our classes are based on the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/) and involve interactive writing exercises.

For training outside the DC area, you must pay the trainer's expenses. We'll come to your managers as well.

## Schedule a class

Please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) to request training at least 3 months before you want to schedule the class. Let us know:

- Which federal agency you work for
- Which classes you'd prefer
- Which month or specific date you'd like the classes - we schedule about 3 months in advance
- How many students will take the class (20—35 people per session is a good number)

After reviewing your request, a trainer will email you to set up the details. Please keep in mind that all of our trainers are volunteers.
