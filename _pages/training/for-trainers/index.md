If you want to develop your own plain-language training, we can help you work with one of our trained instructors to set up a course.

## Getting started

As a first step, you'll want to look at our training materials to get an idea of what you should cover:

- We periodically offer a [Train-the-Trainer Bootcamp]({{ site.baseurl }}/training/train-the-trainer-bootcamp/).

- The [Federal Plain Language Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/) is our handbook for plain-language writers. You can use it to structure a training course. It makes a good text or reference for your students.

- [Tips for Starting a plain-language program]({{ site.baseurl }}/training/for-trainers/tips-for-starting-plain-language-program/) outlines how to develop an effective training program.

- You can also use our training materials to [create your own class]({{ site.baseurl }}/training/for-trainers/create-your-own-class/).

## Guidelines for training

- [Have a topic sentence]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/organize/have-a-topic-sentence/). In [First Things First: The Lost Art of Summarizing](http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Kimble.pdf), Professor Joe Kimble emphasizes the importance of a good opening sentence.

- [Use the active voice]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/conversational/use-active-voice/). The European Commission's Translation Service is running a "Fight the Fog" campaign, which includes many online resources for improving writing. In its [Write Clearly](http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/eu/fight_the_fog_en.pdf) booklet, Fight the Fog gives tips on changing passive voice to active by naming the agent of an action.

- [Organize the information]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/organize/). In [Plain Language: A Handbook for Writers in the U.S. Federal Government](http://www.lauchmangroup.com/PDFfiles/PLHandbook.PDF),  Richard Lauchman explains how to prepare the reader for what to expect by using summary statements, being precise on the subject lines of letters and email messages, and summarizing lengthy documents in one, up-front paragraph.

- [Use tables]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/design/use-tables-to-make-complex-material-easier-to-understand/). You can use tables effectively for much more than just showing numerical data.

- [Use lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/organize/use-lists/). Using lists instead of traditional paragraphs can help you convey detailed information quickly without overloading your readers.

## Further reading

We've included other resources that can help you present training in plain language:

- [Writing Effective Letters](#) is a supplement to the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/).

- The FAA has made its [Plain Language Toolkit](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/plain_language/media/toolkit.pdf) available.
