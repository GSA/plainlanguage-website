We set up the class schedule on a first-come, first-served basis, depending on trainer availability. You must have a .gov or .mil email address to register.

You may request up to 3 sessions of the same class (which we may or may not be able to provide depending on our trainers' availability). If you wish to schedule 2 different _types_ of classes, you can complete this form a second time.
