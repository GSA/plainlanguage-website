## What is my agency doing to promote plain language?

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services offers a [Toolkit for Making Written Material Clear and Effective](http://www.cms.gov/WrittenMaterialsToolkit/). Its focus is health-related materials, but it can be used for many other topics.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has a thriving plain-language program and provides training for its staff throughout the country. As part of that program, it developed a series of [short, funny videos](../../Media/download_files.cfm) highlighting different plain-language techniques.

These agencies have well-established plain-language programs:

- [Environmental Protection Agency](http://www.epa.gov/plainlanguage/)
- [Federal Aviation Administration](http://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/order/branding_writing/order1000_36.pdf)
- [Fish and Wildlife Service](http://pdm.fws.gov/plainlang.html)
- [Health Resources and Services Administration](http://www.hrsa.gov/servicedelivery/language.htm)
- [National Institutes of Health](http://execsec.od.nih.gov/plainlang/)
- [Office of the Federal Register](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/write/plain-language/)
- [Securities and Exchange Commission](http://www.sec.gov/news/extra/handbook.htm)

The Department of the Army, the National Institutes of Health, and the CDC have all developed [training available for anyone to use](../../resources/take_training/index.cfm).
