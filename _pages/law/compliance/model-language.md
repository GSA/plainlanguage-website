[The Plain Writing Act of 2010](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h946enr.txt.pdf) requires federal agencies to write "clear Government communication that the public can understand and use." President Obama also emphasized the importance of establishing "a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration" in his January 21, 2009, [Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Transparency_and_Open_Government/).

We ([insert agency name]) are committed to writing new documents in plain language by October 2011, using the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/TOC.cfm).

We need your help to comply with this Act! Let us know if you have trouble understanding our documents or the pages on our website: [insert agency contact email].

We have assigned staff to oversee our plain language efforts:

- [insert name], Plain Language Contact
- [insert name], Plain Language Coordinator
- [insert name], Plain Language Coordinator

We're training our employees and have [created or strengthened] our oversight process. We must use plain language in any document that:

- provides information about any federal government benefit or service; or
- explains to the public how to comply with a requirement that the federal government administers or enforces.
