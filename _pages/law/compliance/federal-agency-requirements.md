[The Act](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/pdf/PLAW-111publ274.pdf) requires the federal government to write all new publications, forms, and publicly distributed documents in a "clear, concise, well-organized" manner.

While the Act does not cover regulations, two separate Executive Orders emphasize the need for plain language. [E.O. 12866](../../populartopics/regulations/eo12866.pdf) says that regulations must be "simple and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing uncertainty and litigation..." (Sec. 1, Par. (b)(12)) and [E.O. 12988](../../populartopics/regulations/eo12988.pdf) says that each regulation must specify its effect "in clear language". (Sec. 3 Par. (b)(2)).

OMB has posted a [Best Practices Guide for regulations](http://www.regulations.gov/exchange/sites/default/files/doc_files/20101130_eRule_Best_Practices_Document_rev.pdf). They are accepting [comments on the draft Guide](http://www.regulations.gov/exchange/topic/exchange/bestpractices).
