President Obama signed the [Plain Writing Act of 2010](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/pdf/PLAW-111publ274.pdf) on October 13, 2010\. The law requires that federal agencies use "clear Government communication that the public can understand and use." On January 18, 2011, he issued a new Executive Order, "E.O. 13563 - [Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review.](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2011/pdf/2011-1385.pdf)" It states that "[our regulatory system] must ensure that regulations are accessible, consistent, written in plain language, and easy to understand."

Two other executive orders ([E.O. 12866](../populartopics/regulations/eo12866.pdf) and [E.O. 12988](../populartopics/regulations/eo12988.pdf)) cover the use of plain language in regulations.

We've written a [model plain language webpage](law/agency_pl_page.cfm) for you to use.
