President Obama signed the [Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/content-detail.html) on October 13, 2010. The law requires that federal agencies use clear government communication that the public can understand and use.

On January 18, 2011, he issued [Executive Order 13563 - Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/18/executive-order-13563-improving-regulation-and-regulatory-review), which states that our regulatory system must ensure that regulations are accessible, consistent, written in plain language, and easy to understand.

Two other executive orders ([E.O. 12866](https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12866.pdf) and [E.O. 12988](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1996-02-07/pdf/96-2755.pdf)) cover the use of plain language in regulations.
