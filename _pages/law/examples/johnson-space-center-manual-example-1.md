**Johnson Space Center Handbook Chapter--After**

**This could be you . . .**

A hypergol technician didn't follow requirements and caused a major fuel spill and was burned.

A person using a tool didn't follow the requirement to have it tethered. The tool fell 16 stories to the floor. Fortunately no one was hurt.

Two employees spilled a caustic battery electrolyte on their hands. The batteries hadn't been through qualification testing. There were no requirements to prevent the technicians from working with unqualified batteries.

1\. Who must follow this handbook?

This handbook applies to anyone at JSC or JSC field sites, unless exempted in a specific chapter. For this handbook, "JSC" includes all JSC sites in the Houston, Texas, area such as Ellington Field and the Sonny Carter Training Facility. The handbook applies to operations involving JSC personnel or equipment at non-JSC locations, including foreign countries. See Chapter 113, Paragraph 5, for more information on following standards at non-JSC locations.

| 1\. The following table tells you who must follow this handbook.
| ----------------------------------------------------------------
|

**If you . . ._** _**|** Then you must follow . . ._**_** Are a federal employee | This handbook unless you work at a site that involves unique military equipment and operations Are a JSC contractor | This handbook as called out in your contract's statement of work Work at a JSC remote site (such as White Sands Test Facility) as a civil service employee or contractor employee | All chapters that don't exempt you and local requirements that meet the intent of any chapter that exempts you Are a non NASA or non contract employee | This handbook while on JSC property

<br>

1\. If you are a federal employee working in a private employer's facility, you are covered by the JSC safety and health program. Although NASA may not have the authority to correct hazardous conditions in a private sector workplace, NASA must make sure your working conditions are safe and healthful. NASA does this by administrative controls, personal protective equipment, or your withdrawal from the private employer's facility.

2\. If you are a private employer, neither Executive Order 12196, "Occupational Safety and Health Programs for Federal Employees," nor this handbook relieves you or your employees of any rights or responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

2\. What about field sites?

This handbook applies to you if you are at any JSC field site like White Sands Test Facility unless specific chapters exempt you.

1\. If a chapter exempts you, you must develop your own requirements that meet the intent of that chapter.

2\. The local Quality Assurance, Reliability, and Safety Office or equivalent will carry out the responsibilities of the Occupational Safety and Quality Assurance Branch at your site.

3\. How should I use this handbook?

You don't need to read this entire handbook. You need to know and follow only the safety and health requirements which apply to your job.

This handbook contains several features to help you find the requirements you need:

1\. Table of contents and index

2\. Subject index

3\. Tables in the first chapter of each part that tell you which chapters apply to what jobs

4\. Chapter titles

5\. Chapter introductions that tell you who has to follow that chapter

6\. What if this handbook conflicts with the safety or health requirements of my organization?

This handbook takes precedence over all other JSC documentation in safety and health except for more stringent requirements that individual JSC organizations develop. If your organization has more stringent requirements than are in this handbook, you must follow them. If you find any less stringent JSC requirements than are in this handbook, bring them to the immediate attention of the Director of JSC's Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance (SR&QA) Office.

7\. How do I request changes to this handbook?

Submit a written change request to the Occupational Safety and Quality Assurance Branch that includes what you want to change and why. You may use an informal letter or electronic mail. The Occupational Safety and Quality Assurance Branch will review your request and tell you its decision to approve, modify, or disapprove your request. You will find the change process in Attachment 100A of Appendix 1B.

8\. How do the chapter and paragraph numbers work in this handbook?

Chapter numbers have 3 digits. The first is the part it is contained in. The second and third are the sequence in that part. For instance, the first chapter in Part 2 is 200\. The second chapter in Part 3 is 301.

Paragraphs are numbered within a chapter. Subparagraphs are designated with lower case letters and further divided by bullets. To cite a paragraph, or subparagraph, use the chapter number, and paragraph number, and subparagraph letter. For example, this paragraph is 100.7\. If a subparagraph were involved, you would cite it as 101.2.a.
