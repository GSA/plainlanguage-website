## Handbooks, guides, and toolkits

The Department of the Army, the National Institutes of Health, and the CDC have all developed training available for anyone to use.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services offers a [Toolkit for Making Written Material Clear and Effective](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Outreach/WrittenMaterialsToolkit/index.html). Its focus is health-related materials, but it can be used for many other topics.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has a thriving plain-language program and provides training for its staff throughout the country. As part of that program, it developed a series of [short, funny videos](../../Media/download_files.cfm) highlighting different plain-language techniques.
