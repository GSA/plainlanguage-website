We asked the top government plain language regulatory experts to analyze some existing plain language regulations. We hope this will help you develop even better plain language documents.

To see any of these regulations, go to [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/](http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/)<br>
From the drop-down menu, select the title number (the first two digits in the regulation's title) and go to it. Click on the link that includes the regulation number you are interested in. On the resulting page, scroll down to the regulation. Note that on that page, if you click on the left-most column you will be taken to the entire regulation, including a table of contents. If you click on the second column, you will be taken to individual sections, one at a time.

Uses lists pretty well, but could use more. Some sentences could be rewritten to put the main idea first and further clarify language.<br>                | X                                                                                                 | X                  | X                  | Some                       | X

Many very long section titles.<br> | X                  | X                  | X                          | X              | X

Does not include any material suitable for tables. Some of the section titles are too wordy.

Lacks a good overview of the entire process. Tables could have been used to simplify presentation of some complex information.<br>
Many section titles are too wordy. | X | X | X | X | No 25 CFR Part 171 -- Irrigation Operation and Maintenance | Excellent use of all plain language principles except tables, which aren't needed in this rule.<br>
| X | X | X | X | No 43 CFR Parts 3830 - 3838 | Excellent use of all plain language principles. Rule begins with a useful overview that orients the reader to this complex but well-organized material.<br>

Some long sentences; would benefit from using lists and pronouns. | X | Some | X | No | No 49 CFR Part 106 -- Rulemaking Procedures | A wonderfully lucid explanation of the rulemaking process. This rule is a model in every way. | X | X | X | X | X 43 CFR Part 3500 -- Leasing Minerals | Good rule, but very complex. Would benefit from a few sections that summarize the lease process. Good use of subheadings, but many section headings are too long. | X | X | X | X | No 12 CFR Part 602 -- Releasing Information | A good rewrite that could benefit from using question headings. | X | X | X | Some | X

## Key to Terms Used in Tables

Well Organized -- Organized to meet the reader's needs. An overview of the requirements or process comes first, followed by the details. If there is a process involved, the regulation gives the outlines first in a list or table, followed by details in separate sections.<br>

Short Sections -- There are about five or six sections per page of CFR text.<br>

Minimizes Subdivisions -- No section goes below the "(A)" level, unless the material is presented as a table.<br>

Uses lists -- Wherever possible, the rule uses lists rather than text to present information.<br>

Uses tables -- Complex information is in the form of a table wherever possible.<br>

Short Sentences -- While sentences vary in length, no sentence is over 40 words long.<br>

Sentences Start with Main Idea -- Exceptions or qualifications are at the end of the sentence or in another sentence.<br>

Active Voice -- The rule tells readers clearly who does what and does not use passive voice.<br>

Uses "Must" for requirements -- The word "shall" doesn't appear in the rule.<br>

Clear Language -- Rule avoids jargon and legalese.<br>

Uses Pronouns -- Addresses the reader as "you" and the agency as "we" for greater impact and clarity.
