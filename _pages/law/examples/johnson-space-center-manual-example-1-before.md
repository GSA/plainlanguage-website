**Johnson Space Center Handbook Chapter--Before**

_**_ 101.1 Policy

It is the basic policy of JSC to take all practical steps to avoid loss of life, personnel injury or illness, property loss or damage, or environmental loss or damage.

101.2 Goals and Objectives

101.2.1 Goals

JSC's goals are<br>

a. To achieve a successful and unified occupational safety and health program while accomplishing JSC's objective for excellence in human space flight.

b. Of equal importance, to become a nationally recognized center of excellence for occupational safety and health. This excellence will also be a prominent feature of JSC's environmental protection and emergency preparedness program.

101.2.2 Objectives

JSC shall comply with applicable regulations and standards, including those of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<br>

By exercising flexibility and creativity in striving for excellence, JSC will go beyond the minimum requirements of the regulations and standards to provide the best feasible protection for workers at JSC and the environment within the constraints of available resources.

101.3 Purpose, Scope, and Applicability

This handbook is applicable to the White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) except as noted in individual chapters. If a chapter is noted to be nonapplicable to WSTF, WSTF should comply with the intent and develop equivalent WSTF requirements. The WSTF Quality Assurance, Reliability, and Safety Office will perform the same functions for WSTF as the JSC Health, Safety, and Environmental Compliance Office does for JSC. WSTF may use equivalent forms in lieu of JSC forms.

101.3.1 Purpose

JSC recognizes that to become a center of excellence for occupational safety and health, there must be more than just compliance with regulations and standards. The goal can only be accomplished through development and implementation of a comprehensive program stressing improvement and excellence. JSC and contractor employees at all levels must be active participants.<br>

JSC further recognizes that environmental protection and emergency preparedness are natural adjuncts to its occupational safety and health programs. This handbook documents these programs as well.<br>

JSC also recognizes that a successful program requires a vision and commitment to improvement and excellence that extends beyond the boundaries of JSC-administered programs, facilities, and worksites. This dedication to excellence will manifest itself in exemplary safety and health programs and also in associated environmental protection and emergency preparedness programs necessary to support appropriate forums identified in this handbook.

101.3.2 Scope and Applicability

This handbook shall have precedence over all other JSC documentation in safety, health, environmental protection, and emergency preparedness. Conflicts in the requirements of this handbook and other JSC documents shall be brought to the immediate attention of the Director of JSC's Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance (SR&QA) Office.<br>

The scope of this handbook extends to all locations over which JSC has jurisdiction, unless specifically exempted. Executive Order (E.O.) 12196, "Occupational Safety and Health Programs for Federal Employees," 29 CFR 1960, "Basic Program Elements for Federal Employee Occupational Safety and Health Programs," and this document apply to all federal employees at JSC and their worksites, except the employees and worksites that involve unique military equipment, systems, and operations. Requirements and standards contained herein are binding on JSC contractors as incorporated by contract statement of work. Non-NASA, non-contractor personnel will follow the provisions of this document when on JSC property.<br>

JSC federal employees who work in establishments of private employers are covered by the JSC occupational safety and health programs as provided in this handbook. Although NASA may not have the authority to require abatement of hazardous conditions in a private sector workplace, NASA must ensure safe and healthful working conditions for its employees. This shall be accomplished by administrative controls, personal protective equipment, or withdrawal of the JSC federal employees from the private sector facility to the extent necessary to assure that the federal employees are protected.

101.4 Ruling Authorities

The Occupational Safety and Health Act (the Act) Public Law 91-596, 84 Statute 1590, became effective April 28, 1971\. The Act authorizes the development and enforcement of standards to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for employees in the private sector and also contains provisions applying to federal agencies and their employees. Section 19 of the Act requires federal agencies to have comprehensive occupational safety and health programs consistent with the standards authorized by Section 6 of the Act. The head of each agency is required to take other specific actions after consulting with representatives of employees (labor organizations, where applicable).<br>

E.O. 12196 was issued on February 26, 1980\. It directs federal agencies to implement effective occupational safety and health programs, provides for the evaluation of federal agency programs by the Department of Labor (DOL), and provides for the transmittal of these evaluations to the President.<br>

E.O. 12196 also authorizes the DOL to issue program elements to assist federal agencies in establishing and operating their programs with sufficient flexibility consistent with their respective mission, size, and organization. Basic elements for federal employee occupational safety and health programs were published in the Federal Register on October 21, 1980 (29 CFR 1960), and amended by subsequent issuances in the Federal Register. Federal agencies are required to observe these program elements.<br>

Overall policy and responsibility for safety and health within NASA are described in NMI 8710.2, "NASA Safety and Health Program." This document also provides necessary guidance to implement the objectives of NMI 8710.2.<br>

Basic policy and responsibilities for environmental protection within NASA are described in NHB 8800.11, "Implementing the Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act"; NMI 8800.13, "Prevention, Abatement, and Control of Environmental Pollution"; and E.O. 12088, "Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards," as amended. This document provides corresponding guidance for JSC programs.

101.5 Nonconformance Conditions

Four conditions may exist where JSC may not be in compliance with provisions of NHB 2710.1, "NASA Safety and Health Handbook," Occupational Safety and Health Programs, or standards adopted therein. Those conditions and the actions necessary to sustain them are as follows:<br>

a. Nonconformance with specific safety or occupational health policy which is developed solely by NASA may be approved on review by the Director, NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance or the Director, NASA Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, respectively. This review process will facilitate JSC's implementation of specific safety and health policies through different means that provide equal or greater protection for personnel.

b. Nonconformance with specific policy not within the discretion of NASA (for example, different program elements from those required by 29 CFR 1960, E.O. 12196, or a specific OSHA requirement) must be submitted by JSC to the appropriate Headquarters official (i.e., the Director, NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance or the Director, NASA Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications). Review of such request will ensue and, if concurred in, an alternate policy justification for the entire Agency will be transmitted to the Secretary of Labor or other approving authority.

c. Nonconformance with existing standards where the intention is to correct the condition or procedure requires an abatement plan, provided the situation requires more than 30 days to abate. See chapter 104 for requirements to develop abatement plans.

d. Nonconformance with existing standards where the intention is not to achieve compliance requires the development and approval of an alternate/supplementary standard or request for waiver. See chapter 103 for further details.

101.6 Private Employer and Federal Contractor Rights and Responsibilities

No provision of E.O. 12196 or this document shall be construed in any manner to relieve any private employer, including federal contractors or their employees, of any rights or responsibilities under the provisions of OSHA, including compliance activities conducted by the DOL or other appropriate activity.<br>

Protection of employees of private contractors is covered by the provisions of OSHA. E.O. 12196 and 29 CFR 1960 do not apply to employees of private contractors or their working conditions when performing work under government contracts. This handbook is not a direct instruction to JSC contractors, but provides guidance to the responsible JSC contracting officer. For contractors, it is applicable (as appropriate) through contract clauses in conformance with the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. As specified by contract, this handbook applies to all contractor personnel involved in JSC operations. Contractors will retain full responsibility for the safety and health of their employees regardless of whether their employees perform their duties in JSC-owned or leased facilities, with government equipment, or together with government personnel. JSC contracts (including any subsequent contractual direction) will not conflict with or otherwise abrogate this responsibility of contractors for their employees.
