The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services offers a [Toolkit for Making Written Material Clear and Effective](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Outreach/WrittenMaterialsToolkit/index.html). Its focus is health-related materials, but it can be used for many other topics.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has a thriving plain-language program and provides training for its staff throughout the country. As part of that program, it developed a series of [short, funny videos](../../Media/download_files.cfm) highlighting different plain-language techniques.

These agencies have well-established plain-language programs:

- [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/plain-writing/)
- [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/home/plain-writing)
- [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/plain_language/)
- [Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/pdm/plainlang.html)
- [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication/plain-language)
- [Nuclear Regulatory Commission](https://www.nrc.gov/public-involve/open/plain-writing.html)
- [Office of the Federal Register](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/write/plain-language/)
- [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/newsextrahandbookhtm.html)

The Department of the Army, the National Institutes of Health, and the CDC have all developed training available for anyone to use.
