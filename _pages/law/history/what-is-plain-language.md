Plain language (also called Plain English) is communication your audience can understand the first time they read or hear it. Language that is plain to one set of readers may not be plain to others. Written material is in plain language if your audience can:

- Find what they need;
- Understand what they find; and
- Use what they find to meet their needs.

There are many writing techniques that can help you achieve this goal. Among the most common are:

- Logical organization with the reader in mind
- "You" and other pronouns
- Active voice
- Short sentences

- Common, everyday words

- Easy-to-read design features

No one technique defines plain language. Rather, plain language is defined by results--it is easy to read, understand, and use.
