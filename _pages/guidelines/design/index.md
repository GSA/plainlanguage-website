We want our writing to help people get information, comply with requirements, and apply for benefits with the least possible burden. Dense, cluttered writing deters people from taking the time to read.

We've heard from many readers that when they get a dense, uninviting letters or notices from the government, they often put it in the "read later" pile, even though they know they should read it right away.

Designing for reading is an important part of developing effective communications. Writing that legible and well-organized is far easier to understand than more traditional styles. Even with regulations and the limits of publishing in the Code of Federal Regulations, you can use design elements to help users read and understand the information.

## Organize the information

- Limit the page to five or six sections (about two per printed page).
- [Add useful headings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/organize/add-useful-headings.md %}) to help people skim and scan the page.
- [Use lists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/organize/use-lists.md %}) to break up the text and outline steps in a process.
- Avoid having lists within lists or several levels of information.
- [Use tables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/design/use-tables-to-make-complex-material-easier-to-understand.md %}) to make complex material easier to understand.
- Write [short sentences]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/concise/write-short-sentences.md %}) and [short sections]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/concise/write-short-sections.md %}) to break up information into manageable chunks.

## Use simple typography

- Use ragged right margins where possible, rather than centering or justifying your text
- Don't use more than one or two typefaces
- [Highlight important concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/design/highlight-important-concepts.md %}) with simple text formatting
