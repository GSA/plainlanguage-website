title: Avoid hidden verbs
sidenav: guidelines
---

Use the strongest, most direct form of the verb possible. Too often, we hide verbs by turning them into nouns, making them less effective and using more words than we need. Hidden verbs are a particular problem in government writing.

A hidden verb is a verb converted into a noun. It often needs an extra verb to make sense. For example, "Please make an application for a personal loan" is longer and less clear than "Please apply for a personal loan."

Hidden verbs come in two forms. Some have endings such as _-ment_, _-tion_, _-sion_, and _-ance_ or link with verbs such as _achieve_, _effect_, _give_, _have_, _make_, _reach_, and _take_. Often, you'll find a hidden verb between the words "the" and "of."
