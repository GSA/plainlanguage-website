The Department of Health and Human Services has taken a six page article and replaced it with a single, fold-out brochure, conveying the same information. Here is an excerpt.

### Before

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends a half hour or more of moderate physical activity on most days, preferably every day. The activity can include brisk walking, calisthenics, home care, gardening, moderate sports exercise, and dancing.

### After

Do at least 30 minutes of exercise, like brisk walking, most days of the week.
