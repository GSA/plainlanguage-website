There are millions of words in the English language. Many you have never heard before, and many you may have heard but don't know their correct definition, spelling, or pronunciation.

Dictionaries, Thesauruses, and Grammar Sites are excellent tools that can help you clarify your word choice. By using words in their correct context, you will express your ideas clearly, and your reader will benefit from your accuracy. The web contains many useful tools.

Most of us in plain language aren't grammar experts, but we often get calls asking grammar questions, so we've included a few grammar resources here.
