Use this checklist to see if your document meets plain language standards. (If you are writing for the web, here's the additional [weblist](weblist.cfm).) Click on the links for a brief explanation of each standard:

written for the [average reader](pops/averageReader.cfm'))<br>

organized to serve the [reader's needs](pops/organized.cfm'))<br>

has [useful headings](pops/headers.cfm)<br>

uses ["you" and other pronouns](pops/pronouns.cfm) to speak to the reader<br>

uses [active voice](pops/active.cfm)<br>

uses [short sections and sentences](pops/short.cfm)<br>

uses the [simplest tense possible](pops/simple.cfm)--simple present is best

uses [base verbs](pops/base.cfm), not nominalizations (hidden verbs)<br>

omits [excess words](pops/excess.cfm)<br>

uses [concrete, familiar words](pops/familiar.cfm)<br>

uses ["must"](pops/must.cfm) to express requirements; avoids the ambiguous word "shall"<br>

[places words carefully](pops/placement.cfm) (avoids large gaps between the subject, the verb and the object; puts exceptions last; places modifiers correctly)<br>

uses [lists and tables](pops/complex.cfm) to simplify complex material<br>

uses no more than two or three [subordinate levels](pops/levels.cfm)
