- What is health literacy?
- Why is health literacy an issue for health communication professionals?
- Can better communication strategies improve health?
- Where can I learn more about health literacy?

Literacy is defined most simply as the ability to read and write. We can think of literacy as the ability to understand and communicate information. In this context, it is useful to think of health literacy as the ability to understand and communicate health information. The Institute of Medicineï¿½s recent report defines health literacy as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions." In any situation, a person decides what to do based on an understanding of facts, issues, options for action, and consequences. An example from the Ask Me 3 education program illustrates why this understanding is important in a health context. Providers should encourage patients to ask the questions and understand the answers.

- What is my main problem?
- What do I need to do?
- Why is it important for me to do this?

To get the best health outcomes, health-related decisions should be based on clear and correct understanding of relevant health information and services. There are many reasons why this often does not happen. People who are not literate in general will likely not be health literate. People with cultural backgrounds different from the society-at-large in which they live may have attitudes or customs at odds with conventional health practices. People using the health care system may not be able to navigate the system and find the right resources. They must deal with its multiple funding sources, a varied collection of care-giving facilities, as well as public and private organizations, Clearly, there are many challenges to educate, prepare, and assist people in obtaining the resources they need to make good health decisions. Clear communication, in plain language, about health information and services will help create and promote health literacy.
