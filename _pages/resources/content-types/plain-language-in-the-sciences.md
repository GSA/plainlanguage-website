A recent National Science Foundation study shows that:

- Fewer than 50% of adults understand that the Earth orbits the sun yearly.
- Only 21% of adults can define DNA.
- Only 9% of adults know what a molecule is.
- One in 7 adults--25 million people--cannot locate the US on an unlabeled map.
- A third of Americans believe in astrology--and do not understand that astrology is not scientific.
