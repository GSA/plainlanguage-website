The use of plain language is spreading in many areas of American culture. Governments at all levels, especially the federal government, are using plain language more extensively. Other areas where we see a push toward plain language include the sciences and the legal profession. But as these pages discuss, we still have a long way to go to make all documents in these areas easy to read and use.

[in the Federal Government](government/index.cfm)<br>
Government should be accessible to the citizens it governs. It is every citizen's right to understand what the government is doing, and to achieve this government must write more clearly than it does today.

[in the Legal Profession](legal/index.cfm)<br>
As many legal writers point out, legal writing is some of the best--and some of the worst--writing you will find.

[in Business](privsector/index.cfm)<br>
Enlightened private-sector organizations--both companies and not-for-profits--have long used plain language. But widespread use has been slow in coming. People don't try to be unclear; they are following the models they've always used--the academic style and examples of what people before them have written.

[in the Sciences](sciences/index.cfm)<br>
Efforts to write scientific material in plain language are just beginning. As science touches more and more areas of our lives, it's important that we all be more educated about scientific issues and that scientists help by writing more clearly and with the general audience in mind.

[around the US](US/index.cfm)<br>
In addition to government efforts, several important non-profit organizations and groups of professionals support the movement.

[around the World](world/index.cfm)<br>
Governments and private organizations around the world support plain language. Many of these programs have been in place for much longer than our effort here in the United States.
