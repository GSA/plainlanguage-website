The United States is fast becoming a leader in the world-wide plain-language movement. In addition to government efforts, several important non-profit organizations and groups of professionals support the movement.

## Non-profit organizations

The [Center for Plain Language](http://www.centerforplainlanguage.org) is a federally tax-exempt non-profit membership organization made up of people in government, academia, and business who are dedicated to promoting and supporting plain language in the public and private sectors.

The [Legal Writing Institute](http://www.lwionline.org/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving legal writing by providing a forum for discussion and scholarship about legal writing, analysis, and research. One of its major activities is to give a Golden Pen Award to recognize persons who have significantly advanced the cause of better legal writing.

The [Burton Foundation](http://www.burtonawards.com/) is a volunteer, non-for-profit, academic organization concentrating on legal writing. The Foundation sponsors an awards program that rewards partners in law firms and law school students who use plain, modern language and avoid archaic, stilted legalese.

## Journals

The "Plain Language" column in the [Michigan Bar Journal](http://www.michbar.org/generalinfo/plainenglish/columns.cfm) has been publishing articles on plain legal language for more than 20 years. It is the longest-running column on legal writing. The site includes a list of columns and links to many of the more recent ones.

Over the years, The [Scribes Journal of Legal Writing](http://www.scribes.org) has published many influential and widely circulated articles on plain language.

## Associations

The [Association for Business Communication](http://www.businesscommunication.org) is committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship, research, education, and practice.

The [Association of Professional Communication Consultants](http://www.consultingsuccess.org) is a network of professionals providing communication expertise and solutions.

The [Society for Technical Communication](http://www.stc.org) includes technical writers, usability specialists, technical editors, information architects, managers, teachers, Web designers, translators, and many others interested in clear technical communication.

## State and local governments

The [Washington State Government](http://www.governor.wa.gov/priorities/plaintalk/default.asp)has been involved in the plain language movement since the midâ€“1990's.

Texas has a [plain langugage contracts project](http://www.occc.state.tx.us/pages/Legal/plain_lang/).

Oregon also has a [plain language program.](http://plainlanguage.oregon.gov/)

When Charlie Crist of Flordia took office as governor in January 2007, one of his first acts was to issue a [plain langugage executive order](http://www.flgov.com/pl_home). Florida now has an [entire site](http://www.flgov.com/pl_home)devoted to plain language.

The [Quality and Productivity Commission](http://qpc.co.la.ca.us/pl.asp), established by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Los Angeles, also has its own site.
