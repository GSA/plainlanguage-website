title: Identify and write for your audience
sidenav: guidelines

You have to grab your audience's attention if you want to get your ideas across. Let's face it, people only want to know what applies to them. The best way to grab and hold someone's attention is to figure out who they are and what they want to know. Put yourself in their shoes; it will give you a new perspective.

Tell your audience why the material is important to them. Say, "If you want a research grant, here's what you have to do." Or, "If you want to mine federal coal, here's what you should know." Or, "If youâ€™re planning a trip to Rwanda, read this first."

## Do your research

Start by [identifying your users and their top tasks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guidelines/web/IDtasks.md %}). This will help you write clearly and focus on user needs.

Think about what your audience knows about the situation now. Then, guide them from their current knowledge to what they need to know. To help you do this, try answering the following questions:

- Who is my audience?
- What does my audience already know about the subject?
- What does my audience need to know?
- What questions will my audience have?
- What's the best outcome for my agency? What do I need to say to get this outcome?
- What's the best outcome for our audience? What do I need to say to get this outcome?
