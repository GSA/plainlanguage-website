One of the most popular plain language myths is that you have to "dumb down" your content so that everyone can read it. That's not true.

The first rule of plain language is: **write for your audience**. Use language your audience understands and feels comfortable with. Take your audience's current level of knowledge into account. Don't write for an 8th-grade class if your audience is composed of PhD candidates, small business owners, working parents, or immigrants. Only write for 8th graders if your audience is, in fact, an 8th-grade class.

Make sure you know who your audience is â€“ don't guess or assume.
