title: Write effective links
sidenav: guidelines
---

Links are about both content and navigation. Effective link names are key to satisfying your customers. Eyetracking studies show that links written in plain language are the most effective. Plain-language links are written clearly so that the user understands exactly where the link will take them.

- Link names should be the same as the page name linked to.
- Don't use the full name of a document or program as a link name.
- Be as explicit as you can. Too long is better than too short.
- Make the link meaningful. Don't use "click here" or "read more."
- Add a short description when needed to clarify the link.

Remember, you may have users who rely on screen readers. Make sure your links are accessible to everyone. Taking the time to write descriptive link text has the added benefit of improving your [search engine optimization](https://moz.com/blog/click-here-seo).
