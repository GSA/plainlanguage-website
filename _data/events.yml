    Join us for a mostly in-person meeting on Wednesday, December 12, 2018 from 2:00 to 3:30 pm, ET. We’ll discuss the Clarity 2018 conference in Montreal and plan out our plain language meetings for 2019. We realize not everyone can join us in person, but we’ll arrange a Zoom video conference so you can see and hear us.
