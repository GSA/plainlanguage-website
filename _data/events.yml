    For a decade, the Center for Plain Language has issued a yearly report card evaluating how well federal agencies follow the Plain Writing Act. Agencies were judged on organizational compliance and writing quality. This year, the judges focused on the main Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request page and the main Coronavirus page of 21 executive branch agencies, including all 15 cabinet-level departments.
