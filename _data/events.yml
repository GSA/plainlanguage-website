    If you're currently volunteering for PLAIN, whether training, posting social media, or anything else, please come.

    If you're interested in volunteering for PLAIN, please come.

    This meeting will be focused in person, but we'll have a conference bridge line so people who are remote can still join in the discussion.

    One thing: To volunteer, you have to be a federal employee. Sorry. We know many of you are eager to help us out, but according to our charter rules, we can only use feds.

    Be prepared to discuss what you'd like to do. Here are some ideas:

    * social media support
    * community management (posting articles to the list serv, prompting conversations)
    * helping update website using Github
    * monthly meeting coordinator (topics, space, speakers)

    And more!
