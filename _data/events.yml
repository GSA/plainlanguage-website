    We'll host our annual in-person winter gathering potluck on Wednesday, December 11, 2019, from 2-3 at GSA (1800 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20405 -- near the Farraguts).
This will be in-person only. Please bring finger food to share; we won't have access to a microwave. I'll provide cups, plates, napkins, and something to drink.
We'll talk about some exciting PLAIN news, the topics at the Oslo conference, and the upcoming summit and conference in fall 2020.
To RSVP, please email info@plainlanguage.gov.  I'll need your name and your agency for the security desk. I'll send the room number to people who respond.
