    We'll host our annual in-person winter gathering potluck on Wednesday, December 11, 2019, from 2-3pm at GSA (1800 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20405 -- near the Farraguts).
    <br/><br/>This will be in-person only. Please bring finger food to share; we won't have access to a microwave. I'll provide cups, plates, napkins, and something to drink.
    We'll talk about some exciting PLAIN news, the topics at the Oslo conference, and the upcoming summit and conference in fall 2020.
    <br/><br/>**Please RSVP** by emailing your name + agency to [info@plainlanguage.gov](mailto:info@plainlanguage.gov). I'll send the room number to people who respond.
