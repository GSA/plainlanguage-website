    Being able to tell a story is a great talent. People who can tell stories can  motivate people to act, help organizations transform, and highlight our government mission successes.

    Some of us don’t do it naturally; we have to learn it. In this session, Bethany Blakey will provide some templates and approaches for crafting simple stories to suit our purpose.
